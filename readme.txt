COMP3217 Security of Cyber-Physical Systems 23/24 Coursework 2

## Description
This coursework involves utilising machine learning techniques to effectively compute labels for the testing data. Part A involves implementing binary classification, and Part B involves implementing multi-label classification. Cells in both notebooks should be run all at once, and this can be achieved by navigating to 'Run All' in the 'Runtime' tab on the menubar on the top of the page.

## Models used in Part A and B
Linear SVM (not used for final submission)
Logistic Regression (not used for final submission)
Random Forest (used for submission)
Files can be uploaded by clicking on the 'Choose Files' button that appears when the second cell of the notebook is executed. The GridSearch cells will take longer to execute, so please refer to the output stored by the notebook to view the performance of the models. The following notebook contains code for both Part A and B: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GWyeoMJxvJn4m5ByKgOqV0J2UTpDQYcv#scrollTo=nPZIPm9ZhRci

## Final model used for submission
The following notebook contains the Random Forest Classifier (best performing model) used to compute labels for the test data for Part A and Part B: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iDWk_wqfoc4smHuvLkd8WYasl8hkFd5T#scrollTo=hqvvOAsxEsh9. This is used for the final submission, so all training and testing files must be uploaded here. Files can be uploaded by clicking on the 'Choose Files' button that appears when the second cell of the notebook is executed.
